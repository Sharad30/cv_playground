# Computer Vision Playground

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of binary image classification using various state-of-the-art models. The current implementation focuses on cat vs dog classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Features

- Support for multiple SOTA models (ResNet, EfficientNet, ViT, MobileNet)
- Configurable training parameters
- Custom data transformations and augmentations
- Interactive UI for data visualization
- GPU support
- Fine-tuning capabilities

## Training

```bash
python classification/train.py
```
